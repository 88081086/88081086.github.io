10.24 Block acknowledgment (block ack)

The block ack mechanism improves channel efficiency by aggregating several acknowledgments into one
frame. There are two types of block ack mechanisms: immediate and delayed. Immediate block ack is suitable
for high-bandwidth, low-latency traffic while the delayed block ack is suitable for applications that tolerate
moderate latency.


10.24.3 Data and acknowledgment transfer using immediate block ack policy and delayed
block ack policy

If the immediate block ack policy is used, the recipient shall respond to a Basic BlockAckReq frame with a
Basic BlockAck frame. If the recipient sends the Basic BlockAck frame, the originator updates its own record
and retries any frames that are not acknowledged in the Basic BlockAck frame, either in another block or
individually.
在Immediate block policy下，recipient针对BAR立刻回应BA，originator能立刻重传丢失的帧，所以实时性较好

If the delayed block ack policy is used, the recipient shall respond to a Basic BlockAckReq frame with an Ack
frame. The recipient shall then send its Basic BlockAck frame response in a subsequently obtained TXOP.
在delayed block policy下，recipient不会立刻回应BAR，而是需要等到下一个txop，所以实时性较差

10.24.4 Receive buffer operation

NextExpectedSequenceNumber被初始化为ADDBA里的SSN。收到BlockAckReq后，往上传送buffer中的msdu直至碰到hole。
收到mpdu后

  - 如果buffer满，往上传送msdu
  - 如果buffer未满，但buffer里最小的SN与NextExpectedSequenceNumber相等，则往上送mpdu（为什么不是msdu？）

只要往上报了msdu，NextExpectedSequenceNumber被更新为msdu的SN+1


10.24.7.2 HT-immediate block ack architecture

For each HT-immediate block ack agreement, the recipient chooses either full-state or partial-state operation
(this choice is known only to the recipient). A STA may simultaneously use full-state operation for some
agreements and partial-state operation for other agreements. The scoreboard context control stores an
acknowledgment bitmap containing the current reception status of MSDUs or A-MSDUs for HT-immediate
block ack agreements. Under full-state operation, status is maintained in statically assigned memory. Under
partial-state operation, status is maintained in a cache memory; therefore, the status information is subject to
cache replacement. This entity provides the bitmap and the value for the Starting Sequence Number subfield to
be sent in BlockAck frame responses to the originator.

10.24.7.3 Scoreboard context control during full-state operation
10.24.7.4 Scoreboard context control during partial-state operation

full-state和partial-state对报文和bar的处理差异

block ack agreement establishment建立阶段：full-state的WinStartR来自ADDBA的SSN，partial-state的WinStartR来自data报文的SN和BAR的SSN。

数据和BAR处理。如果partial-state的情况下能找到record，则它与full-state的处理一样，收到数据时：

收到bar时

如果partial-state未找到record，则有不同的处理。收到数据时

11.5.4 Error recovery upon a peer failure

Every STA shall maintain an inactivity timer for every negotiated block ack setup, unless the block ack
agreement is set up for a GCR group address.

Recipient reset timer
1) when MPDUs corresponding to the TID for which the block ack policy is set are received and the Ack Policy subfield in
the QoS Control field of that MPDU header is Block Ack or Implicit Block Ack Request.
2) when a BlockAckReq frame corresponding to the TID for which the block ack policy is set is received.

收方在收到数据和bar时reset timer

Originator reset timer
1) when a BlockAck frame corresponding to the TID for which the block ack policy is set is received. 

发送方在收到ba时reset timer

When a timeout of BlockAckTimeout is detected, the STA shall send a DELBA frame to the peer STA with the Reason Code field set to TIMEOUT and shall
issue an MLME-DELBA.indication primitive with the ReasonCode parameter having a value of TIMEOUT.
